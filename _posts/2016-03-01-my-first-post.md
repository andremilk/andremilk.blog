I've had the intention to create this blog for a while now, but kept postponing it forever. The main purpose of it would be to share my thoughts, solutions and interests.

 

Some of that information I've been keeping for myself but not in a much organized way and neither consistently. 

 

Then I gave a "lecture" about basic [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) usage and it's concepts in an event ([Academic Week](http://www.dsc.ufcg.edu.br/~sacc/)) held by the [Computer Science Department](http://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/) of my [university](http://www.ufcg.edu.br/index1.php) and decided to adapt a document I've made to guide me through the topics into some sort of tutorial. I was going to share it with the students merely through a Google Docs document but a friend of mine insisted I did this through the blog I was so long overdue.

 

I am writing this using a nice service I've just found out called [prose](http://prose.io), if you are interested in writing a blog using Jekyll it might be useful!

 

(the posts will be written mainly in english but perhaps I will translate them into portuguese as well)
