## Intro to Docker

The following posts will be an adaptation of a tutorial I've created for a intro lecture I gave about Docker and it's uses to help Computer Science students in their tasks. 

It was created heavily based on the official Docker documentation (that you should definitely read) but in portuguese and with some minor aditions of some explaning with my words. The original document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2_vhAWnj8AqAtSOZX4WBiBPgxlnA4p0QW0Y0WvQN50/edit?usp=sharing).

## Introduction (brief explanation)
Containers are not some sort of [new technology and neither a linux invention](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2_vhAWnj8AqAtSOZX4WBiBPgxlnA4p0QW0Y0WvQN50/edit?usp=sharing). 

However Docker has made it fairly simple to create and use linux containers and so in the last couple of years there's been a huge hype around it. 
I've discovered Docker by accident and thought that perhaps it would be useful for me to solve a dependency problem that a project I was working with had. It was not on my top list of solutions for that problem at the time, but I was interested. 
After playing around with it a little I was told to look for other linux container technologies and have a [look at them...](http://slides.com/andreleite/teste-de-apresentacao/#/) I was in awe of how easy using docker was compared to the alternatives I've tried ([lxc](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/), [linux-vserver](http://linux-vserver.org/Welcome_to_Linux-VServer.org) and [lmctfy](https://github.com/google/lmctfy)).
