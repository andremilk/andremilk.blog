## Experimenting with Jenkins and Docker

I decided to play a little with Jenkins so that I could learn more about CD/CI and about Jenkins itself... turns out I can play with it using Docker.

***


## Installing

I went on the documentation to see how one would go about [installing Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins) and to my amusement I could use [docker to help](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+with+Docker) me with that.

	docker run  -d -p 49001:8080 -v $PWD/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home  -t jenkins 
    
If you don't want to have it running on another port you may configure a reverse proxy (or just get the port forwarding from 80 to 8080).

When I ran this command my container would not stay up, it would always be exited.
docker logs showed:
	touch: cannot touch ‘/var/jenkins_home/copy_reference_file.log’: Permission denied
	Can not write to /var/jenkins_home/copy_reference_file.log. Wrong volume permissions?

A-ha... so what do I do now? [This solved this problem for me](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/issues/177#issuecomment-163656932).

	sudo chown 1000 $PWD/jenkins/

So just start your container with `docker start` and you are good to go!

	docker start <container-name>

## Creating new jobs

Ok, now let's get something to be built on our newly installed jenkins.
(Disclaimer: I had to choose one project to be analysed on one of my university classes and after some browsing and voting (the professor said it should be written in Java and have more than 10k lines of code) we decided to use [retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit).
